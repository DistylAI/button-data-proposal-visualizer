You are an expert in designing AI system iteration frameworks. Your task is to identify distinct "iteration shapes" or "iteration profiles" of AI systems.

An **iteration shape** describes the characteristics of a system that determine how an iteration system should work with it. Different shapes require different iteration strategies, feedback mechanisms, testing approaches, and improvement cycles.

Below are {{ proposals|length }} AI system proposals with their full dimensional classifications.

## Your Task

Analyze these systems and identify 8-12 distinct **iteration shapes**. For each shape, consider:

1. **Iteration Velocity** - How quickly can the system be improved?
   - Fast (hours-days): Automated eval, simple testing, quick deployment
   - Medium (days-weeks): Some human eval, moderate testing
   - Slow (weeks-months): Expert evaluation, extensive validation, compliance checks

2. **Feedback Mechanism** - How do we know if changes improved the system?
   - Automated metrics (exact match, similarity)
   - Proxy metrics (indirect measures)
   - Human evaluation (simple or expert judgment)
   - Delayed/real-world feedback (days/weeks later)

3. **Failure Mode Complexity** - How hard is it to diagnose and fix issues?
   - Simple: Single-shot inference, one prompt, clear errors
   - Moderate: Sequential chains, multiple prompts, some branching
   - Complex: Deep chains, dynamic prompts, distributed state, many integrations
   - Very Complex: Multi-agent, adaptive prompts, compensation logic

4. **Validation Requirements** - What testing is needed per iteration?
   - Minimal: Unit tests, basic smoke tests
   - Standard: Integration tests, regression suite
   - Extensive: End-to-end tests, performance tests, security tests
   - Maximal: Regulatory compliance tests, safety validation, expert review

5. **Root Cause Analysis Difficulty** - How hard to trace failures?
   - Easy: Single LLM call, obvious errors
   - Moderate: Sequential chain, log analysis reveals issues
   - Hard: Branching paths, need detailed tracing
   - Very Hard: Distributed state, async operations, external dependencies

6. **Change Impact Scope** - When we iterate, what might break?
   - Narrow: Single prompt change, isolated impact
   - Medium: Multiple prompts, sequential dependencies
   - Wide: System-wide changes, integration impacts
   - Critical: Changes affect safety, compliance, or revenue

## Output Format

Return a JSON array of iteration shapes. Each shape should have:

```json
[
  {
    "shape_name": "Fast-Iterating Single-Shot Systems",
    "description": "Systems that can be improved rapidly with automated feedback",
    "iteration_velocity": "Fast (hours-days)",
    "feedback_mechanism": "Automated metrics",
    "failure_mode_complexity": "Simple",
    "validation_requirements": "Minimal",
    "root_cause_difficulty": "Easy",
    "change_impact_scope": "Narrow",
    "iteration_strategy": "Rapid experimentation with automated testing. Use A/B testing, quick prompt iterations, automated regression detection.",
    "example_characteristics": [
      "Single-shot inference",
      "Simple structured output",
      "Ground truth available",
      "No external integrations",
      "Stateless"
    ],
    "estimated_proposals_matching": 50
  }
]
```

**Key Requirements:**
1. Create 8-12 distinct shapes that cover the full spectrum
2. Name each shape descriptively (focus on ITERATION characteristics)
3. Each shape should represent systems that need SIMILAR iteration approaches
4. The iteration_strategy field should explain HOW to iterate on systems with this shape
5. Consider the interaction of multiple dimensions (e.g., complex evaluation + mission critical = very slow iteration)

**Good shape names emphasize iteration:**
- ✅ "Fast-Iterating Single-Shot Systems"
- ✅ "Compliance-Constrained Slow-Iteration Systems"
- ✅ "Multi-Integration Fragile Systems"
- ✅ "Expert-Eval-Dependent Systems"
- ❌ "Tool-Using Agents" (too architecture-focused)
- ❌ "Customer Service Systems" (too business-focused)

Return ONLY the JSON array, no other text.
